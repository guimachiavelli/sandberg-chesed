# quotes

> Chesed stands for expansiveness and the creation and building-up of form, what can very appropriately be referred to as anabolism

> The concept of Chesed-Love is that of freely giving

> Chesed corresponds to the creative aspects of leadership, and early texts are one-sided in characterising this by love, mercy and majesty

> The Zohar also contains many references to the "rigorous severity" of God (another synonym for Gevurah) and its being the source of evil in the creation. However, when one considers that the creation and uncontrolled growth of a cancer would correspond to Chesed, and the attempts of the immune system to contain and destroy it would correspond to Gevurah, it should be clear that it is not useful to consider creation and destruction in terms of good and evil. It is useful to look at a living, organic system as a balance between these two opposed tendencies


# first thoughts

The idea of this growing, cancerous shape that evolves into a sort of cacophonous block is what comes to my mind. One needs to make it grow and bask in this glory of unbridled acceptance that grows continuously. I imagine it having a very intimate connection with the next poem, gevurah, and both being more or less the same thing, only with a different and goal.

Perhaps: have a sort of square delimiter; inside of it this thing springs to life, moves and pulsates; by loving it, by giving it power, it grows; on gevurah, the stream of power is constant and the writhing mass needs to be constantly cut and forced inside the square; on chesed, it is the opposite, it needs to be fed to break through its assigned area.
